# Cholesterol level analysis in R
The dataset of a controlled experiment, in which the cholesterol level LDL was measured in [mg/L], was given. 
First, I analyzed the dataset using ANOVA, then I analyzed the dataset using regression analysis. Tests like post-hoc test were conducted. 
This Project was done as a part of the course 'Applied Biostatistics' under the supervision of Dr. Erwin Fuhrer, Faculty member at IIT Mandi.
