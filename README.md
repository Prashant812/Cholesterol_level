# Cholesterol level analysis in R
The dataset of a controlled experiment, in which the cholesterol level LDL was measured in [mg/L], was given. 
In this dataset, there are two different factors: The effect of medical drugs (3 groups: Placebo, Drug A and Drug B) and the factor
lifestyle (2 groups: 1 hour of exercise and low carb diet).
I analyzed the dataset using ANOVA and using regression model. For the analysis, I have also used tests like t-test, post-hoc test.
This Project was done as a part of the course 'Applied Biostatistics' under the supervision of Dr. Erwin Fuhrer, Faculty member at IIT Mandi.
